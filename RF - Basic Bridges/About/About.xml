"Basic Bridges," as the name so subtly suggests, allows you to build bridges. (Well, technically, you could also create piers or even a boardwalk. It's really up to you.) No special research is required. All you need is wood or stone. And a bit of steel for reinforcement if you're building over deep water.

All bridges support light construction, so you can, for example, use a bridge to run a power conduit across a river. Additionally, stone bridges will support heavy construction, so you can actually place walls on them.

The fishing functionality which used to be part of this mod has been split off into its own "add-on" mod, so those who want bridges without fish can now have them.

=====

Compatibility:

"Basic Bridges" can safely be added to a game in progress, but if you try to remove it from a game in which you've actually built any bridges, you will of course make the map unplayable.

This mod shouldn't conflict with any other mods.

=====

Credits:

The code in "Basic Bridges" borrows a bit from Sulusdacor's "[sd] Bridges" mod. And obviously, the mods are very similar on a conceptual level. I just decided that I wanted a simpler bridges mod, that would be fully compatible with my "Fertile Fields" mod.

The traditional Chinese language files were provided by Steam user Alane.

License:

If you're a modpack maker and want to include "Basic Bridges" in your pack, or if you're a modder and want to use it as the basis of a derivative mod, please feel free to do so. I ask only that you let me know about it.

If you have any (helpful) suggestions for improvement, please let me know!
