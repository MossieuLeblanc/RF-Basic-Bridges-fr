  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Basic Bridges"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 05/06/2017
	- Initial release.

- 05/06/2017
	- Added boardwalks ("bridges" on land adjacent to water).

- 05/09/2017
	- Bridges now support light construction, so you can, for example, put
	  torches on them or use them to run power conduits across rivers.
	- Boardwalks still need to be placed near, but no longer need to be directly
	  adjacent to, water tiles.
	- Changed terrain overwrites to patches.

- 05/14/2017
	- Basic bridges can now be built on mud, as well as over marsh or water.
	- Added the ability to create "fishing spots" on bridges or piers for pawns
	  to relax and catch fish.
	- Improved (in my opinion, anyway) the bridge textures.

- 05/15/2017
	- Added the ability to build bridges from stone instead of from wood.

- 05/26/2017
	- Improved the "catch" chance for fishing pawns.
	- Added a bit of variety to what can be caught while fishing.
	- Fish must now be cleaned (at a butcher's table) before they can be eaten or
	  used in recipes. As a side effect of this change, fish also now yield more
	  meat than they did before.
	- Added a sushi recipe.
	- Stone deep water bridges now correctly require steel in addition to stone
	  blocks.
	- Blocked the exploit that allowed floors (and walls) to be built on top of
	  bridges.
	- Eliminated the unused "bill" option at fishing spots.
	- Improved the patch XML. This should improve efficiency and (mostly)
	  eliminate compatibility issues with other mods.

- 05/27/2017
	- Users of RimRue's "Tribal Essentials" will now be able to clean fish at
	  butchering spots and make sushi at stone ovens.

- 05/30/2017
	- Skill gain while fishing is now substantially slower. Fishing wasn't
	  intended to be a quick way to level up a pawn's shooting skill.
	- Squid are no longer categorized both as "dead fish" and as "raw resources,"
	  but only as "raw resources."
	- Fish now rot much more quickly, on a par with other meats.
	- Cleaned up the patch XML a bit more, to get rid of the annoying (but
	  inconsequential) error messages that were showing up when "Basic Bridges"
	  is used together with Shinzy's "Bridgello" mod.

- 06/01/2017
	- There is now a (very small) chance that pawns will be bitten by oddly
	  aggressive fish while fishing. So it's no longer a "perfectly safe" way to
	  gain joy and food.
	- Stone bridge graphics have been improved. Wider bridges will no longer have
	  "holes" throughout.
	- Fishing spots must now be placed at least 12 tiles away from any other
	  fishing spots.
	- Fish (and other items) should now stack properly as they're caught.
	- The chance of finding sunken treasure has been lowered significantly, and
	  if it is found, it'll most likely be only a small amount of silver.
	- Fishing-related messages (except for notices of pawns being bitten) are now
	  simple text alerts rather than notifications that have to be dismissed.

- 06/02/2017
	- Fishing-related text messages (except buried treasure notifications) are
	  now silent.

- 06/02/2017
	- Eel skin is now a thing.
	- Dead fish and squid are now categorized as corpses instead of as resources.
	  (Yeah. I was an idiot.)
	- The nature of notifications for various fishing results are now
	  individually configurable.
	- "Junk" or "treasure" notices now tell you exactly what was found.
	- The problem of fishing rods being left behind forever when fishing jobs are
	  interrupted should be "mostly" fixed now.

- 06/03/2017
	- Squid is not nearly as difficult to catch now as I'd inadvertently made it
	  originally, though it does still require a moderately skilled pawn and of
	  course can only be caught in the ocean.
	- The various meats are now just labeled "meat" rather than "raw meat," for
	  consistency with other types of meat.
	- Added "[RF]" prefix tag to the mod's name for easier mod list sorting.

- 06/04/2017
	- Added a configuration option to determine whether fishing pawns haul their
	  own catches to storage.
	- It is now possible to fish from marsh tiles as well as from water tiles,
	  though pawns are more likely to be bitten while fishing in marshes than 
	  when fishing in water.

- 06/06/2017
	- Fish now yield twice as much meat.
	- Eels are significantly more common now in marshes, but can still be caught
	  in rivers, lakes and oceans, as well.
	- It's no longer possible to add fish to a normal butcher bill, since doing
	  so would yield no meat, anyway.
	- Pawns are now somewhat less likely to be bitten while fishing.
	- XML defs no longer try to inherit from core abstracts. (It probably wasn't
	  creating any problems, anyway, but it's better this way.)
	- Made a few more minor edits to the XML patches.

- 06/11/2017
	- Stone bridges will now support heavy construction, so you can use them to
	  support walls if you so desire. (Note that this change isn't retroactive.
	  Preexisting stone bridges in games already in progress will not support
	  heavy construction. Only newly-built stone bridges will.)

- 07/03/2017
	- Added a variety of specific fish which can be caught in various biomes, so
	  that pawns aren't always just catching generic fish. The graphics were
	  created by Steam user Draegon.
	- New fish types are: arapaima, jellyfish, piranha, pufferfish (the meat from
	  which is toxic until properly prepared in sushi), salmon, sea cucumber (the
	  meat from which can be used to make herbal medicine), and sturgeon (which
	  might yield some caviar when butchered).
	- Fish are now classified simply as animal corpses, rather than as a special
	  type of corpse, and can be butchered with the standard butchering recipe.
	  The fish-specific butchering recipes have therefore been removed.
	- Added "shellfish traps," which can be constructed next to piers or bridges.
	- Added lobsters, crabs, crayfish, snails and shrimp, any of which might be
	  caught in the new traps.
	- If "Vegetable Garden" is installed, this mod's generic sushi recipe will be
	  replaced by that mod's nigiri and maki roll recipes.
	- Squid leather and eel skin now weigh substantially less and provide less
	  thermal insulation than was previously the case. As well, items made from
	  them will be much less commonly found in use or for sale by traders and
	  raiders.

- 07/04/2017
	- Fixed a backwards compatibility issue involving the old butchering recipes.

- 07/05/2017
	- The boiled shellfish recipe now actually works, allows the use of any kind
	  of vegetables rather than just potatoes, and also requires Cooking skill of
	  just 3 rather than 6.
	- Recipe filters across the board are now more sensibly defined.
	- As butchering shellfish doesn't yield anything, it's no longer possible to
	  use shellfish in the "butcher creature" recipe. So pawns should now stop
	  wasting your lobsters in futile butchery attempts.
	- Shellfish traps will now be reduced in efficiency if other traps are in
	  close proximity to them.

- 07/05/2017
	- Shellfish trap blueprints, as well as already-constructed traps, will now
	  block construction of new traps within a six-tile radius. (That's how the
	  traps were supposed to have been working all along.)

- 07/23/2017
	- Instead of having a random chance to be "damaged beyond repair" without
	  warning, shellfish traps now take damage each time something is caught, so
	  that pawns assigned to construction work can keep them repaired and prevent
	  them from being destroyed.
	- Shellfish-related recipes are now usable at stone ovens from RimRue's
	  "Tribal Essentials" mod.

- 08/05/2017
	- Wooden bridges are now made of "stuff," meaning that if you have a mod that
	  adds new types of wood, bridges can now be built from them. Preexisting
	  wooden bridges on saved game maps will pale by comparison. Literally. They
	  will turn white, since they're not made of "stuff" as they're now supposed
	  to be. But they'll still function correctly.
	- If you're using "Feed the Colonists," you'll have options at the stove to 
	  cook the mod's meals four at a time as well as singly.
	- Added traditional Chinese language files, courtesy of Steam user Alane.

- 08/09/2017
	- Shellfish traps will now take twice as long as before to catch something,
	  but will yield twice as much per catch, thus providing essentially the same
	  amount of food, but requiring less frequent visits from pawns.
	- Traps also now have a chance of taking damage with each catch, rather than
	  always taking damage. This should reduce the need for pawns to run all over
	  the map repairing them constantly.

- 08/29/2017
	- Split fishing into a separate "add-on" mod, so that those who want bridges
	  and only bridges, can finally have them.
	- Added a "watergazing spot," which allows pawns to relax and watch the water
	  even if fishing spots (which are now in the add-on mod) aren't available.

- 09/24/2017
	- Watergazing spots are now much less graphically obtrusive.
